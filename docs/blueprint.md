## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming blue (#5DADE2) to instill trust and innovation, but also give it some character and a tech-forward vibe. This evokes reliability and trustworthiness without being too cliche.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) to provide a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A warm orange (#FFB347) to draw attention to calls to action and highlight key elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use minimalist, modern icons relevant to e-commerce, AI, and design. The icons should use the same primary color as a fill, or secondary color as an outline.
- Employ a clean and intuitive layout that makes effective use of white space.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and loading animations to improve the user experience.
